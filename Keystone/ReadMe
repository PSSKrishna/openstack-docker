Docker Image Contains:
# centos with systemd
# keystone

Add a User and Database on MariaDB for Keystone
* for noobs
  # create database keystone;
  # grant all privileges on keystone.* to keystone@'localhost' identified by 'password'; 
  # grant all privileges on keystone.* to keystone@'%' identified by 'password';
  # flush privileges;
  # exit

It contains some docker build arguments so you have to create your own docker image 
# keystone_host
# password = adminpassword [ default ]

For Creating Docker Image using Dockerfile
* copy keystone folder to your host and get into the directory
* change configuration files as per requirements 
  * for ntp.conf
    use your ntp server for better convenience
  * for keystone.conf
    * We have to generate a random token to access the Keystone service, as shown in the following commands: 
      # python -c "from uuid import uuid4; print uuid4()" 
      # openssl rand  -hex 10
    * Replace admin_token with the random token that gets generated,  as shown in this configuration option: 
      # admin_token = 01d8b673-9ebb-41d2-968a-d2a85daa1324  
    * memcache_servers = ip:11211
    * ( MariaDB connection info ) - change mariadb_host, password, username, database name
      # connection = mysql+pymysql://username:password@mariadb_host/database_name
    * search this type of block [token] and changes its provider 
      [token]
      # provider = fernet      
* use docker build -t imagename:version --build-arg keystone_host=keystone_host_ip --build-arg password=adminpassword .
* wait and check the image from docker images
* open respective port of keystone:5000, httpd:80 on host
If selinux is enabled then
* setsebool -P httpd_use_openstack on 
* setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on 
* setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db on
